# Predicting-people-using-ANN-Bank_problem
This Artificial Neural Network model will Predict the number of people willing to stay in a bank or exiting the bank

## ANN 

Artificial Neural Networks Which is a fascinatng topic to learn in Machine Learning ,because

1. Making predictions using patterns.

1. Hyperparameter tuning .




The module I have used here is [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) ,which has been created by [Google](https://www.google.com/).<br>

## Concept 

The concept here is pretty much simple and easy to understand as well.

### Neuron

A neuron is the part of our brain , but here in Deep learning it refers to the nodes which carry weights.

### Synapse

Synapses are connections between two or more neurons which are interlinked by synapses.

### Layers 

Layers are the one Which will connect both **Neuron** and **Synapses** together to form  a network.



### Neural Network 

The Neural Networks are pretty much same to our *brain* but It tries to mimic our brain.

##  Accuracy

The accuracy is about 86 percentage .<br><br>
*If you want to increase the accuracy you can increanse the dataset or try a new one with more layers or use callbacks or using weight decays*.

Although it is a basic ANN program.
